Are you tired of the C++'s mile-long convoluted error messages?
Are you in constant fear of accidentally triggering undefined behavior?
Do you want to stop being abused by the compiler?

Fret not! Now you can abuse the compiler and get revenge for all these years.

Presenting the functional template based programming language.
For a quick factorial computation example look into ```main.cpp```.

Features:
 - recursion
 - variables
 - let in statements
 - conditions
 - any data type potential

Limitations:
 - variable and function names are ints, can be improved with constants
 - default max template recursion depth is 1024, can be increased
 - awkward syntax
